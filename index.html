          Goodbye, schemas and SQL.
          Hello, JSON and MapReduce.
          CouchDB is a database built for the web.

          <p>
            You're designing for the modern world.
            Here, needs change, and fast.
            You have to produce solutions quickly,
            and they have to be updatable at a moment's notice.
            It's running on your laptop now,
            but next year it'll be running on a multi-terabyte cluster.
          </p>
          <p>
            For such demands, you need the right tools.
            You're pretty happy with your server-side framework and your JavaScript toolkit,
            but that relational database ...
            it chops up your business objects,
            it bites you when you shake things up,
            and SQL doesn't play nicely with your scripting language
            &mdash; this sledgehammer has never sat comfortably in your toolbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            You want a database that understands <em>objects</em>.
            You want to talk to it in your native language.
            It should accept the odd new attribute without balking.
            And it should offer all the scalability and reliability that kept you hanging onto that RDBMS.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Enter CouchDB.</b>

            <h3>Flexible</h3>
            <p>
              Start saving your data today, and <strong>adapt your queries as your application evolves</strong>, without migrating data formats.
              Query your data using familiar JavaScript (or your language of choice).
              CouchDB's views are <strong>optimized for real-time</strong>, rather than batch, workloads.
              Its MVCC data model is suitable for concurrent operations that require <strong>consistency</strong>.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h3>Web scale</h3>
            <p>
              CouchDB can <strong>scale</strong> from a smartphone to a data-center.
              Erlang and REST present the <strong>same, simple API</strong>
              whether running on a small local instance,
              an ad-hoc network of collaborators,
              or a multi-terabyte eventually-consistent cluster.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Reliable</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Committed updates are durable:</strong>
              CouchDB uses append-only storage, never touching any bytes already written to disk.
              Even truncating a CouchDB database file yields a <strong>consistent snapshot</strong> of an older version of the database.
              Writes are contiguous, giving CouchDB predictable performance even under heavily concurrent write load.
            </p>

            <h3>Ground computing</h3>
            <p>
              Write <strong>offline-capable applications</strong> using a simple document model:
              CouchDB solves the data-island problem for you.
              <strong>Peer-based replication</strong> allows for flexible deployments,
              data-sharing between organizations, and no-hassle backups.
              Running <strong>CouchDB on the client</strong> with continuous replication to remote servers
              offers better latency and reliability than traditional three-tier architectures.
            </p>

            <h3>Trusted</h3>
            <p>
              CouchDB is deployed by the <strong>BBC</strong>, Meebo, Cloudant and Ubuntu One.
              It ships as a <strong>core feature of Ubuntu Linux.</strong>
              There are access libraries available in nearly every language.
